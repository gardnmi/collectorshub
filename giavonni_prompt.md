I want to build an ebay-like, one sided marketplace / website. Here is my attempt to outline my requirements very clearly so they can be implemented properly from the beginning. Please read all instructions first before developing or implementing anything. Then determine the most user friendly and efficient approach while also remaining cost effective.

I’ve outlined the following details below

Purpose of the site:

-   I need to build a website to organize and display a full inventory of my collectibles

-   Prospective buyers should be able to make offers for a single item or their entire wishlist.
    

General Requirements:

-   I need an external facing website for prospective collectors to view items I have for sale, view multiple pictures per item, see product details, and price for each individual item.

-   The Admin will require a backend content management system for me up upload multiple pictures, descriptions, tags, and prices for each individual item.
    
-   I do not intend to transact payments through this website so I do not need payment integration.
    
-   However, I do need to give prospective collectors the ability to add items to a wishlist. The wishlist should calculate the total cost of their entire wishlist.
    
-   The collectors should be able to create an account/Login through all of the popular authentication systems like Google, Facebook, Apple ID, or email address.
    
-   Prospective collectors should be able to communicate with me through a Messaging and offer system
